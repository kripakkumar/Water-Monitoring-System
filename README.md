Water Level Monitoring System (Simulation Project)
 •
 Simulated a water level monitoring system using Proteus and MPLAB with a PIC18F4580 microcontroller, featuring both 
Manual and Automatic modes for motor control.
 •
 Integrated pushbuttons, SPDT switches, an L293D motor driver, and an LM016L LCD to display real-time water levels, 
motor status, and operational mode, ensuring efficient water management
